Hi! All

I am a new user of Portable Thunderbird and I would like to seek help 
from fellow users, who are more experienced, to solve a problem.

I think I should explain it first. I usually get my mails by POP using 
Thunderbird installed in my machine (Mine is a Gmail account). But I 
would like to use Portable Thunderbird at the Cybercafe where I usually 
surf the Web. According to the instructions given on the Portable 
Thunderbird website, I copy my profile from my machine into the profile 
folder of Thunderbird in my USB. At Cybercafe, I use the portable exe to 
download my mail by POP while surfing at the same time. When I get back 
to my place, I copy the profile in the USB into my machine again.

The problem is that the amount of my saved mails are daily growing 
larger. It is no problem in the machine but a real problem in the USB.

Is there anyway to remove mails saved in the profile of the Portable 
Thunderbird in my USB, and yet manage to use POP? I needn't keep them there.

cheers!

PDT

PDT,

You have a couple of options.  You can selectively copy over bits of 
your mail store.  If you look inside your profile directory, you'll see 
individual directories and files that correspond to your mail folders. 
What you could do is create an Archive folder (for easy identification) 
and keep all your older mail you don't want to take with you inside 
that.  Then, copy all your mail folders over except that one (and 
sub-folders).  It's actually just a big bunch of text files, so you can 
really do what you'd like with them.

Also, you should compact your folders on a regular basis to save space. 
  Deleted messages are not removed until you do... even if you empty 
trash.  Just click on any Local Folder and then select FILE and then 
Compact Folders from the main menu.

Regards,
John

Hello,

I'm trying to install Thunderbird for Windows and Linux on my USB Stick and share my profile between them.
As it seems not to be possible to use the same profile folder for both Linux and Windows (as there are system specific components in it) it is necessary to have two profile folders and to create symbolic links for the mail folder, the address book and so on.
The problem is: with Linux it is not possible to create symbolic links as the USB Stick uses the VFAT file system; Windows links can be created but Thunderbird does not except them (i.e. no mails appear in Thunderbird).
Is there any possibility to circumvent these problems?

Regards
Carsten Scharfenberg
